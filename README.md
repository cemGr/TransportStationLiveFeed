 In this project, I want to process the live feed of a transportation provider and
 answer the following questions:
 1. Given the current location of a person and number K as input, find K
nearest station based on available devices, e.g. bikes, scooters, etc.
 2. Given the current location of a person who has a bike/scooter and number
 Kas input, find K nearest bike/scooter stations where docks are available.
 3. Given a source and destination location, for example, Los Angeles, present
 the route on Google maps or another mapping product of a person using
 Metro bike
